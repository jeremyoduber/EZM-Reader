# HTML5 Reader for Electric Zine Maker

A web and mobile friendly way to show off [Electric Zine Maker](https://alienmelon.itch.io/electric-zine-maker) zines on itch.io.

See live example [here](https://jeremyoduber.itch.io/js-zine).

## Usage Instructions

- Copy the PNG files from your Electric Zine Maker save folder into the 'pages' folder with their original filenames.
- If you're not using the default EZM template, change the TEMPLATE constant in ezmreader.js. As of release all EZM templates are available but Fancy templates are not yet fancy.
- To change the background color, modify the hex value in the BGCOLOR constant in ezmreader.js.
- To add a description or plaintext copy for screen readers, change the ALT constant.
- To turn off smoothing and get more pixelated images, set SMOOTH to false.
- Turn pages with arrow keys or A&D, or click/tap on page edges.

- If you are hosting your zine directly, you can change the metadata in index.html to have more control of what the preview will look like when your zine is linked to on social media.


### itch.io specific instructions
- Compress the whole thing into a zip file and upload to itch.io as an HTML project that will be played in the browser.
- Set the viewport dimensions to whatever you like.
- The reader is mobile friendly in either orientation, but for better readability on small screens, set it to Landscape.
